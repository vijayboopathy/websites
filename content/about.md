Hey there! I'm Vijayboopathy Elangovan, a Site Reliability Engineer with over nine years of experience in the DevOps world. I'm all about making sure systems run smoothly and efficiently, especially when it comes to production services that serve thousands of customers. I've got a knack for managing daily deployments, keeping CI/CD pipelines humming with GitHub Actions on AWS, and troubleshooting any platform hiccups, from databases like Postgres and Redis to Heroku dynos and DNS.

My journey in SRE and DevOps has taken me through various start-up environments, where I've gained deep technical knowledge and hands-on experience. I'm particularly passionate about container orchestration with Rancher and Kubernetes, and I love automating cloud operations using Python, Bash, and Ansible. In fact, I've even managed to optimize AWS usage, cutting down monthly bills by a good 30%!

I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Anna University, but my true passion lies in DevOps and continuously learning new tech. Right now, I'm diving deep into the Linux kernel and exploring the Go programming language. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate, share insights, and connect with fellow DevOps enthusiasts. Let's build something awesome together!
