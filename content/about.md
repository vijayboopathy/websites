As a Site Reliability Engineer at Airbase, I ensure the availability and performance of production services that serve thousands of customers. I manage daily deployments to production servers, maintain the CICD infrastructure using GitHub Action self-hosted runners on AWS, and troubleshoot and resolve any issues with the platform, including Postgres, Redis, Heroku dynos, DNS, and other related components.

I have over nine years of experience as an SRE/DevOps Engineer, working with multiple clients in the start-up space. I have detailed technical knowledge and hands-on experience in the DevOps discipline, including the implementation of container-based orchestration solutions using Rancher and Kubernetes. I have also automated most of the cloud operations using Python, Bash, and Ansible, and optimized the AWS usage, reducing the monthly bill by 30%. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mechanical Engineering from Anna University. I am passionate about DevOps and continuously learning new technologies and skills. I am currently diving deep into the Linux world and taking a dig at Go. I am looking for opportunities to collaborate and share my expertise with other DevOps enthusiasts.
